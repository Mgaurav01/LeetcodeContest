/*
A square matrix is said to be an X-Matrix if both of the following conditions hold:

All the elements in the diagonals of the matrix are non-zero.
All other elements are 0.
Given a 2D integer array grid of size n x n representing a square matrix, return true if grid is an X-Matrix. Otherwise, return false
*/

/*
Input: grid = [[2,0,0,1],[0,3,1,0],[0,5,2,0],[4,0,0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: Refer to the diagram above. 
An X-Matrix should have the green elements (diagonals) be non-zero and the red elements be 0.
Thus, grid is an X-Matrix.
*/
//Constraints:

//n == grid.length == grid[i].length
//3 <= n <= 100
//0 <= grid[i][j] <= 105

CODE :-

class Solution {
public:
    bool checkXMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int n = grid.size();
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        for(int j=0 ;j<grid[i].size();j++)
        {
            if(i==j || (i+j) == n - 1)
            {
                if(grid[i][j] == 0) return false;
            }
            else {
                if(grid[i][j] != 0) return false;
            }
        }

    return true;
